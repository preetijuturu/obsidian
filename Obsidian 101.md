## What's Obsidian?
- A  note-taking application; write in Markdown
	- Markdown cheat-sheet: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
- Has the capacity to create linked data networks based on your notes to help find connections between files
- Create "vaults" for different projects; can switch between them easily

# Obsidian Features

---
      
##  Settings + Plugins 
-   Check out plugins (presentation mode, graph view, search, audio recorder and more)

---
##  Graph View
- Visualized notes with internal links
- More links in notes = more visualization
- Can organize by tags

---

##  Internal Linking
-   Create links to files within vault; they auto-complete
	-   i.e. [[New Urbanism]], [[markdown-cheat-sheet]]
	-   i.e. [[CV_Juturu_2021 (1).pdf]]
-   Syntax: [[File Name Here]]
-   Graph view is based on this
- NOTE: External linking is just normal Markdown; i.e. [My GitHub](https://github.com/preetijuturu/). Also, you can internally link a file as well as embed it into another.

---

##  Tags
- Helpful for note grouping
- i.e. #FreeBritney --> graph view can sort notes by tags 

---

## Embedding Files
- Syntax: ![[file.extension]]
	- i.e. ![[CV_Juturu_2021 (1).pdf]]
		-  Acceptable files
			-   Images, Audio, Video, PDF, Markdown
